# River Boat Hire Management System

## Project Overview

This Python program is designed to assist the owner of a river boat hire company in calculating daily profits from hiring out 10 rowing boats on the river. The system provides functionality to calculate the money taken for each boat, find the next available boat, and generate an end-of-day report showing total money taken, total hours hired, unused boats, and the most-used boat.

## Tasks

### Task 1 – Calculate the money taken for one boat

- Input and store data for a boat, including boat number, money taken, total hours hired, and return time.
- Calculate the cost of hiring a boat based on the hourly rates.
- Update the running total of hours hired and the time when the boat must be returned.
- Ensure boats cannot be hired before 10:00 or returned after 17:00.
- Output the money taken and total hours hired at the end of the day for each boat.

### Task 2 – Find the next boat available

- Extend Task 1 to work for all 10 rowing boats.
- Use stored data to find out how many boats are available for hire at the current time.
- Display the earliest time that a boat will be available for hire if no boats are currently available.

### Task 3 – Calculate the money taken for all boats at the end of the day

- Use stored data for each boat to calculate the total money taken and the total number of hours boats were hired that day.
- Identify how many boats were not used on that day.
- Determine which boat was used the most and provide a report for the owner showing this information.

## Testing

Ensure to test the program with various scenarios, including hiring boats for different durations, finding the next available boat, and checking the end-of-day report.
